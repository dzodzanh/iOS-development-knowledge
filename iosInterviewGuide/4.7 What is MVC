- MVC is Model, View, Controller
  + Model: application data is presented by model
  + View: responsible for drawing UI
  + Controller: control the data flow between the view and the model
  
- Model & View never communicate with each other directly and instead rely on Controller to coordinate the communication
- The limit of MVC
  + It not suitable for the large project because we will put all the logic about the data and how to draw the UI in the controller.
  It make the controller very big, make it hard to maintain, extend or debug
