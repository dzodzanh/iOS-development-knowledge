1. What is singleton
  - Singleton is the class that return only one and the same instance everywhere
2. Why singleton is so bad
  - Global access:
      + Any part of your code can use and change the data store in singleton make them become unreliable
        (we will not sure about the data in singleton is right)
      + hard to unit test: some TC run before change the data of singleton, make the TC run after fail
