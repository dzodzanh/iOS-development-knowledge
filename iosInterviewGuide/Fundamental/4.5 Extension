1. What is extension
  - Extension is used to add additional
    + Computed properties
    + Type properties
    + Instance/type method
    + Make existing class conform to protocol without subclassing
2. Drawback:
    + Globaly apply: it will applied to all instances of that type, even if they were created before extension was defined
    + Cannot add stored properties
