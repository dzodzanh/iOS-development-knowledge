There are 2 way to layout
    + CGFrame:
        . define exacly the coordinate (x and y) and the size of UI (width and height)
        . This way is hard to use because it is difficult to calculate exactly the coordinate and size of UI for multiple screen size
    + AutoLayout:
        . define the relationship between view, it call constraint
        . the UI will automatic reponsive to multiple screen size
