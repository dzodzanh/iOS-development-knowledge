1. Story board
    - Advantage: it visible, we can see the layout of view without build app
    - Disavantage: it hard for the team working in the same story, because it cause merge conflict and it hard to fix.
                    But if each view has 1 storyboard (xib file) then this problem will hardly to see
2. Programmatically
    - Advantage: merge-conflic free
    - Disavantage:
        + make the code too long to handle constraint
        + It not visible, we must build the app to make sure the layout is fine
