1. The diagram

AppDidFinishLaunching -> ApplicationWillEnterForeground -> ApplicationDidBecomeActive -> ApplicationWillResignActive -> ApplicationDidEnterBackground -> ApplicationWillTerminate
                                                                  ↑____________________________↑
                                                                  
2. App launch

  - Step 1: AppDidFinishLaunching:                    application has finish launching
  - Step 2: ApplicationWillEnterForeground:           will call after recieve phone call, messages, other system interupt
  - Step 3: ApplicationDidBecomeActive                finish up the transition to foreground


3. App terminate
  - Step 1: applicationWillResignActive               is about to inactive (phone call, home button)
  - Step 2: applicationDidEnterBackground             app enter background. you have 5s to back thing up
  - Step 3: applicationWillTerminate                  is about to remove from the memory, do task to clean up
  
4. State of app
  - Not running
  - In-active: the app run on foreground but not recieve user interaction. It occur when receive phone call, messages
