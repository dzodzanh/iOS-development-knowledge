0. General
  - When we receive the JSON or XML response from the backend API we need
    + Step 1: serialize data
    + Step 2: mapping data

1. Data Serialize:
  - Convert the JSON response to Dictionary
  - Example:
      + JSON reponse:
          {
              post: {
                  title: 'This is an awesome post!',
                  body: 'Loads of text ...',
                  tags: ['Awesomeness', 'Coolness', 'Greatness!'],
              }
          }
      + Serialize object from json response
          var post = [String: AnyObject]()
          post["title"] = "This is an awesome post!" as AnyObject?
          post["body"] = "Loads of text ..."
          post["tags"] = ["Awesomeness", "Coolness", "Greatness!"] as AnyObject?
      
 2. Data mapping
    - Map the dictionary to custom model
    - 2 way to data mapping
        + You can manually, take the value of each key and
    assign them to the properties of custom model
        + Mantle or ObjectMapper: these library will help declare key/property mapping
