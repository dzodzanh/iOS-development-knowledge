1. General
  - When working with multi-threading on iOS, we do not want to block the main UI thread
  => Every networking request should be execute on a background thread
  
2. Solution
  - The third-party library (Alamofire/AFNetworking) and NSURLSession already have
  threading mechanics build in execute their requests on a background thread and
  call completion blocks on the main thread
  - All the HTTP requests the NSURLSession makes are executed on a background thread,
  and it could be either configure to excute completion callback on the main thread
  or on a background thread
  
  => If your callback is executed on a background thread but you need to do some UI updates,
  we use GCD blocks
  
  DispatchQueue.main.async {
      // update UI
  }
