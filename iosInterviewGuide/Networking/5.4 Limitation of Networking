- The request can take time if
    + upload or download a large file
    + in case poor connection
    
- Handle the async, because the data return form the server will not return in order we want

- For example: load user image get from the server to a tableview
	=> Problem: the download will take time and not return in order
	=> Solution:
		+ Take time: Just download the image enough to show on the screen and some back up images
		+ Not in order: Need to compare the id to make sure the image is right with the user
