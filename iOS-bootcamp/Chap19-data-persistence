1. User default
  - Advantages:
    + Easy to use: since you don’t have to worry about how to access the file system, how to create and read files and which file format to use
    + Can store any kind of data
    + Shared across devices through iCloud.
  - Disadvantages: the space for user defaults is limited and they can be quite slow. This makes them practical only for small portions of data
  - Use it for: store flag, settings of an app.
  - Not use it for: 
    + it’s better to use them only for preferences and settings and not to store other kinds of data
    => For those, use one of the other iOS storage technologies.
